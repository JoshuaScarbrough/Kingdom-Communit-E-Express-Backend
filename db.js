/**
 * I set up our database configuration here.
 * 
 * I did a few things to make testing work better:
 * 1. I made it not auto-connect during tests (was causing problems)
 * 2. I added some methods to control connections in our tests
 * 3. I separated the test database from our main one
 * 
 * This handles all our PostgreSQL connections.
 * I made it know whether we're testing or not.
